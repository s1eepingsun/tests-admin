<h2>Friends!</h2>
<p align="center"><em>Here is the new version of Baker's dozen solitaire!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Baker's Dozen is a solitaire card game using a deck of fifty-two playing cards. The game is so called because of the 13 columns in the game, the number in a baker's dozen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the cards are dealt into columns of four on the tableau, resulting in 13 columns. Any King that is in the top or middle of each column must be placed on the bottom before the game starts. Two Kings that are mixed into one column are placed on the bottom without changing their order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the game is to build all the cards onto the four foundations. The player must first free up the four aces and if one of them is found, it is placed on the foundation. Building on the foundation is up by suit, each from ace to king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the top cards of each column can are available, and cards on the tableau, if they cannot be placed on the foundations yet, can be built down regardless of suit. Furthermore, once all cards are taken out of a column, the column can never be filled</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can play as a regular user or a registered user. The registered users retain the entire game history with an option to return to any previous game and continue any take, an option to bookmark the best hands, leave a commentary, participate in a competition with other player and send personal messages to other registered players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to register you simply need to enter a name (starting with 3 characters) and a password (no less than 5 characters). If such a name is already registered in the game, you will have to enter another one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon exiting everything is saved automatically. After logging on the next time you will find yourself in the same state you were in when you last left.</p>

<p align="center">Upper button panel</p>

<p>Undo, redo (also arrow left and arrow right keys on the keyboard) allow you to undo and redo moves at your discretion, up to the very beginning.</p>
<p><strong>New game</strong> - starts a new game. By repeatedly pressing the new game key you can scroll through games and choose the hand you prefer. By pressing the arrow up/arrow down keys on the keyboard you can move through the hands offered. Only those hands that you have started playing (meaning those you have made at least one move in) will end up in your game history.</p>
<p><strong>Start over</strong> - begins a new attempt.</p>
<p><strong>Automove</strong> - automatically does all the moves from the playing area and the bank to the house</p>
<p><strong>Special move</strong> - this allows for a fast scroll back over the sequence of moves until you reach the stage required. This helps you quickly locate the stage where you possibly had made a mistake. After having pressed the special move button, select any card on the desk and click on it. The computer brings you back to the initial positioning of this card, meaning the moment you made the first move with said card (if nothing happens, it means you have not yet moved this card). You can exit the special move mode by repeatedly clicking the special move button, or by pressing the ESC key.</p>
<p>&nbsp; After selecting special move you can scroll your decision with Redo and Undo buttons. Until you have made a new move you may cancel the special move by pressing the "cancel special move" button (where the special move button previously was).</p>
<p><strong>Available moves</strong> - this highlights the card you can make a move with, in yellow. This does not mean that you absolutely have to make said move; the choice is yours. When following a correct strategy, you do not make all the moves randomly, but you use a certain strategy.</p>
<p>You can turn off this mode by once again clicking the "possible moves" button.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Attempts</strong> - the number of your attempts is indicated above, with an option to return to any one of them. The large number indicates the number of the current attempt. The red color number indicates the number of hands you have been dealt and which you have solved.</p>
<p>When playing a yet-unsolved hand, by returning to it you will see the previous positioning of the cards. In solved hand mode you will end up in the beginning and may scroll your decision with the Redo and Undo buttons.</p>
<p>A green dot under the "mark card" button means you have Internet connection, a red dot means you are disconnected. You can still finish the hand while disconnected, but it will not be saved in your history and will not participate in the rating unless the connection restores while you are solving the hand.</p>

You can "play in random order" - by pressing the "new game" button a random-numbered hand will load up; choosing the "play in succession" mode loads up the numerically successive hand. By setting the "only hands played by me" mode or "only hands solved by me" mode you will receive hands in numeric succession or randomly, but in said respective mode. Also you may enter the hand number in the "enter hand number" bar and select the hand difficulty level.</p>
